# ConnectFour

This was the final project we did for AP:CSA. 

We used Java to recreate the beloved Connect 4 game. We used Eclipse and its window builder plugin to create the UI for this project.This was our first time using the Swing GUI component of Java. 

At first, we struggled getting the basic components like JLables and Jbuttons to show up but ,as time went on, we started getting better at Swing gui and were able to create a connect four board and display the images and buttons. Early on, We decided to make a connect four class that would have an array of 1's and 0's to represent the players' coins. The gui would then refrence this class to do all of its functions such as adding coins and determining the winner.

I really enjoyed working on this project as it showed the practical potential of Java. I realized I could use Java to make all kinds of apps and games and not just for random algorithmic problems.

**Note to Download and run the project:**

If you want to run the files from the project files directly, you will have to download eclipse and enable the window builder plugin to get it to run without errors and as intended.

**So to solve this issue, I have included the exported Jar file of this project. All you need to is download the ConnectFour.Jar and run it. (Make sure you have Java installed on your device)
